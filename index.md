## What is this site?

This site is a just a silly side project made by me, [HÃ¥vard Brynjulfsen](https://havardbrynjulfsen.design). It's a collection of my favorite fun facts. You see, I have a tendency to blurt out random fun facts at parties or when hanging out with friends. Despite the high quality of the facts some of my ~~best friends~~ former friends claim that they aren't excactly _fun_. I beg to differ.

## Why the name "noel.fun"?

A stand-up comedian once had a bit about the struggle of choosing baby names and pleaded that his wife wouldn't name their son "Noel" because it sounded like the name of a person who would spew out fun facts at a party. Alas, my nickname is now "Noel".

## What's a 'classic go-to'?

Some facts are more fun than others. The classic go-tos are my personal favorites. Akward silence? Hit them with a classic!

## Do you have any sources to back these facts?

This is just a personal blog of mine. I've obviously read or heard them somewhere, so you'll just have to take my word for it.
