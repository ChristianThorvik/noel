                <h2>What is this site?</h2>
<p>This site is a just a silly side project made by me, <a href="https://havardbrynjulfsen.design">Håvard Brynjulfsen</a>. It's a collection of my favorite fun facts. You see, I have a tendency to blurt out random fun facts at parties or when hanging out with friends. Despite the high quality of the facts some of my <s>best</s> former friends claim that they aren't excactly <em>fun</em>. I beg to differ.</p>
<h2>Why the name &quot;noel.fun&quot;?</h2>
<p>A stand-up comedian once had a bit about the struggle of choosing baby names and pleaded that his wife wouldn't name their son &quot;Noel&quot; because it sounded like the name of a person who would spew out fun facts at a party. Alas, my nickname is now &quot;Noel&quot;.</p>
<h2>What's a &quot;classic go-to&quot;?</h2>
<p>Some facts are more fun than others. The classic go-tos are my personal favorites. Awkward silence? Hit them with a classic!</p>
<h2>Do you have any sources to back these facts?</h2>
<p>This is just a personal blog of mine. I've obviously read or heard them somewhere, so you'll just have to take my word for it.</p>
